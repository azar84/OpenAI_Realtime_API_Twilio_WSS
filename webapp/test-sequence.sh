echo "2. âœ… Ngrok starts second (tunnels WebSocket Server)"
echo "3. âœ… Ngrok URL is obtained and verified"

echo "5. âœ… .env update is verified"

echo "   â€¢ Health checks verify services are ready"
echo "   â€¢ Script exits if any step fails"
echo "   â€¢ .env update is verified before proceeding"
